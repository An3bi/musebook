# What's In Town?

The Muse is located right in the heart of New York, NY.  Specifically, we are in the Chelsea / Flat Iron area.  Whether you're hungry, thirsty, or just in need of a walk around town, there's plenty to do.

We've listed just a few places here, but always feel free to poke the Muser to your left or right for new suggestions!

**Challenge!** Ask a fellow Muser for directions to these places, and learn a new face!
