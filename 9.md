By Alex Cavoulacos

You just walked out of an interview—nailed it!

But the interview actually isn’t done yet. In fact, most hiring managers pay very close attention to how well (and how rapidly) you write a thank-you note.

So, our advice? Get that puppy out as soon as humanly possible. Our email template makes it super easy.

Subject

Thank You

Body

Hi [interviewer name],

Thank you so much for meeting with me today. It was such a pleasure to learn more about the team and position, and I’m very excited about the opportunity to join [company name] and help [bring in new clients / develop world-class content / anything else awesome you would be doing] with your team.

I look forward to hearing from you about the next steps in the hiring process, and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide additional information.

Best regards,
[Your name]

Pro Tips

If you really want to blow a hiring manager out of the water, add in another few lines before “I look forward to...” with some ideas you have on how you could add value. Think: a quick mock-up of something you discussed in the interview if you’re in a creative role, taglines if you’re in branding, or some slides or possible partners if you’re in business development or sales. TryAlexandra Franzen’s tips for giving the hiring manager something he or she can’t resist.
If your interviewer is more traditional or you have a feeling he or she is the type who’d appreciate a handwritten note, feel free to drop a card in snail mail, as well.
