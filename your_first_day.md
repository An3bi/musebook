## Muse Buddy
New friends! Your Muse buddy is a Muse vet who will help you get the lay of the land. In addition to grabbing a [coffee](whats_in_town.md) (or something) in the next week or so, your Muse buddy will snag you and bring you over to Whiskey Friday this week, our Friday in-office happy hour that takes in the cafe over by the bar (or if they are OOO or WFH, now you know!).

Don't forget to ask your buddy to explain our Muse Core Values :) 


## Muse Protocols

This week, be sure to review our [Protocol Guide](https://hackpad.com/THE-MUSE-PROTOCOL-owqWdyFAUi3) that touches on everything from how to get in the building after 5 (there's a code), to connecting to the wifi, to fridge protocol, to HR contacts (might be handy as your setting up your benefits in the coming weeks).


## Good to Knows

**Standup** - a daily meeting many teams have where they discuss what they have on the docket.
 
**Unlimited Vacation** - is real. If you are taking advantage of our vacation policy, be sure to discuss ahead of time with you manager and ensure you have coverage while you are OOO (i.e. if you are an AM, ask the appropriate Muser to respond to time sensitive emails/matters while you're away).

**Benefits** - [Anne Ake](mailto:Anne.Ake@trinet.com) can answer any questions you have about the different options - health, dental and eye coverage.

**Wageworks** - also something Anne can help you with. Wageworks is a commuter benefit plan that allows you to buy metrocards (etc.) with pre-tax dollars.

**Anyperk** - deals on everything from gym memberships, to restaurants, to car rentals, et al.

**Expenses** - This is our [Expense Report Form](https://docs.google.com/a/themuse.com/forms/d/16sPVKnGJdTfdUoudWqxEGWc1jR_TrtHN4q7jldJtvkk/viewform) - if you have questions about reimbursement, ask Matt K! Email receipts to [receipts@themuse.com](mailto:receipts@themuse.com)!
