# Welcome to the MuseBook


### What is this guide?

This is a living, breathing document that guides you through all the inner workings of **The Muse**.  Where to get pens, how to make the coffee, who can I ask about adding a new feature to the website, etc... it's all here.

### How long should it take for me to memory all this?

Umm... you don't! This will be your reference guide for as long as you work here.  You'll have access to this 24/7, so don't hesitate to use it as a resource at any time.  ***Shhhh***... Even the co-founders use it!


### What else will be in this book?

Over time, this book will grow to include...
* List of things we will add that we didn't get too...
* 2...
* 3...



                                         Happy Musing!
