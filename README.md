# Welcome to the MuseBook


## Your guide to getting started @ The Muse

### What is this guide?

This is a living, breathing document that guides you through all the inner workings of **The Muse**. Where to get pens, how to make the coffee, who can I ask about adding a new feature to the website, etc... it's all here.

###  What are the most useful parts of this book?
We highly recommend reading through the "Your First Day" section as well as the top Muse articles. It's a way to learn what we do and why we do it.





                                         Happy Musing!
