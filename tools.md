# Tools


### Hipchat


The chat tool used for internal company communication, complete with GIFs. 
Double check with you manager to ensure you were added to all of the relevant groups!
 

### Hackpad

Musers use Hackpad as a shared document tool for all sorts of things. Here youâ€™ll find the Muse Team Roster, Team Interest in Skills Trainings, Events/Opportunities for Musers, Whom to Ask About Anything At The Muse, and other Hackpads (Index[here!](https://hackpad.com/Hackpad-Index-zaVUi9AT5yD) ) relevant to your team or role. Full index here. 
This week, be sure to review our Protocol Guide that touches on everything from how to get in the building after 5 (there's a code), to connecting to the wifi, to fridge protocol, to HR contacts (might be handy as your setting up your benefits in the coming weeks).


### Salesforce

If you're in Sales, make sure you ask Mark or Dylan to get you set up ASAP, and have you added to the right dashboards. If you're not familiar w/ Salesforce, Mark or Dylan will give you a 30-40 minute walk through.


### Chartio

If you're in AM or Onboarding, make sure you ask Lindsay to get you set up.



### Additionals


We also use Google Docs and sometimes Dropbox, so ask your manager if there's any confusion about where to find what.
