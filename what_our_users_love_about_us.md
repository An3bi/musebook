# Happy Reader Testimonials

Wanted to say thank you to everyone at the muse ! I'm an HR director in Israel and your site has helped me in so many ways, personally and professionally. I share your articles with friends, family and candidates all the time via Facebook and email and I look forward to your Sunday newsletter each week. I gave learned and gained so much from your articles and articles that you feature from other sites. Your articles are truly helpful and so relevant, it's as if you read my mind! -- for example, interviewing tips, how to break bad habits, making emails better, as well as articles dealing with co workers etc. You are a fantastic resource, so glad I found you and you should all know that your hard work has really really paid off!

Hi I just wanted to take the time and say thank you to all of you at The Muse for your hard work and getting information out to those who are working and to those who are not (like me). Your website has been very helpful, especially in the resume area and I like how you keep your website clean and simple. Please don't change your website too much. Thank you and a fan for life!

I just wanted to say a very heartfelt thank you. I recently moved to a new city and have been heavily job searching for the past month or so. The articles on your website about cover letters and informational interviews have been particularly helpful- I had never done informational interviews before this past week and having clear, honest, helpful advice has been invaluable. Your website has become that go-to friend that I need for career advice and I can't thank you enough!

Hi there Musers, 

This email is simply a thank you as I was able to find a great job with the help your listings!

I was job hunting fruitlessly for months and then I found your website. The articles (which were lifesavers) got me through a few tough days at my current job and also helped me improve my outlook on my career. I perused your job listings the most out of all of the job sites because you kept the listings fresh and relevant to the startup industry in NYC. 

Many times I was discouraged in my search, but the friendly feel of your site and encouraging words deposited daily into my inbox were enough to keep me going. 

Needless to say, after applying 3x to a company you advertised, I have finally landed the job. 
Using interview questions from your articles, figuring out my goals and even strengthening my mental toughness, I have not just landed any old job that will fill my time and pockets. I will now be part of a team in an industry that is relevant to my life and other pursuits I am looking forward to accomplishing. 

A million thanks are being sent your way, even though you had kindly rejected my job application as well. 
There is not a better job site than the Muse and I wish the absolute BEST for any of your company's future endeavors. 

THANK YOU!!!!
